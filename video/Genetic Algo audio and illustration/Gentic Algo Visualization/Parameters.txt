Used for testing:
	Popsize: 20
	max gens: 20
	cross over func: Single Point
	Reproduction scheme: Trunkated Rank-based
		parent rate: 0.75
	elite rate: 0.1
	mutation rate: 0.1
	mutation size: 100%

Lower selection pressure
No increase of population average performance over time: No convergence

Better performing:
	Popsize: 30
	max gens: 30
	cross func: two-point
	Reproduction scheme: Trunkated Rank-based
		parent rate: 0.5
	elite rate: 0.15
	mutation rate: 0.05
	mutation size: 100%

higher selection pressure
Some increase in population average over time
